With its default configuration (with the @disableAutoIndex@ configuration key set to @false@), the plugin is indexing
automatically any searchable domains when GORM/Hibernate do a save or an update in the database.
It also delete automatically from the index any document corresponding to a domain that is deleted from the database.
You normally shouldn't have to worry about indexing, but sometimes you may have to do it by yourself, for example on dirty
domain object that you may not want to save right now.

The plugin is providing a few injected methods in the domain or in the @ElasticSearchService@ to allow that.
