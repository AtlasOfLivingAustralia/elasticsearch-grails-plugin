== Elasticsearch GORM plugin

An Elasticsearch plugin for Grails; This project is a fork based on the great work done by the guys at https://github.com/mstein/elasticsearch-grails-plugin.

=== Why would you want to fork the original Elasticsearch plugin?

The original Elasticsearch plugin relies on *Hibernate-specific* GORM components, thus rendering it unusable if you back your Grails application by any other database.

=== How can I obtain the plugin?

The plugin is still in beta, so it hasn't been officially released to Grails' plugin center. +
In the meantime you can install the plugin in one of two ways:

==== Inline

==== Binary Dependency
